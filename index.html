                <p>Nikola Tesla (/ˈtɛslə/; Serbian Cyrillic: Никола Тесла;[2] pronounced [nǐkola têsla];[a] 10 July 1856
                    – 7 January 1943) was a Serbian-American[4][5][6] inventor, electrical engineer, mechanical
                    engineer, and futurist who is best known for his contributions to the design of the modern
                    alternating current (AC) electricity supply system
                    <br><br>
                    Born and raised in the Austrian Empire, Tesla studied engineering and physics in the 1870s without
                    receiving a degree, and gained practical experience in the early 1880s earlying in telephony and at
                    Continental Edison in the new electric power industry. In 1884 he emigrated to the United States,
                    where he became a naturalized citizen. He earlyed for a short time at the Edison Machine earlys in
                    New
                    York City before he struck out on his own. With the help of partners to finance and market his
                    ideas, Tesla set up laboratories and companies in New York to develop a range of electrical and
                    mechanical devices. His alternating current (AC) induction motor and related polyphase AC more,
                    licensed by Westinghouse Electric in 1888, earned him a considerable amount of money and became the
                    cornerstone of the polyphase system which that company eventually marketed.</p>

            </div>
            <p>Attempting to develop inventions he could patent and market, Tesla conducted a range of experiments with
                mechanical oscillators/generators, electrical discharge tubes, and early X-ray imaging. He also built a
                wireless-controlled boat, one of the first ever exhibited. Tesla became well known as an inventor and
                demonstrated his achievements to celebrities and wealthy patrons at his lab, and was noted for his
                showmanship at public lectures. Throughout the 1890s, Tesla pursued his ideas for wireless lighting and
                worldwide wireless electric power distribution in his high-voltage, high-frequency power experiments in
                New York and Colorado Springs. In 1893, he made pronouncements on the possibility of wireless
                communication with his devices. Tesla tried to put these ideas to practical use in his unfinished
                Wardenclyffe Tower project, an intercontinental wireless communication and power transmitter, but ran
                out of funding before he could complete it.[8]</p>
            <p>
                After Wardenclyffe, Tesla experimented with a series of inventions in the 1910s and 1920s with varying
                degrees of success. Having spent most of his money, Tesla lived in a series of New York hotels, leaving
                behind unpaid bills. He died in New York City in January 1943.[9] Tesla's early fell into relative
                obscurity following his death, until 1960, when the General Conference on Weights and Measures named the
                SI unit of magnetic flux density the tesla in his honor.[10] There has been a resurgence in popular
                interest in Tesla since the 1990s.[11]

                <p>Nikola Tesla was born an ethnic Serb in the village of Smiljan, within the Military Frontier, in the
                    Austrian Empire (present day Croatia), on 10 July [O.S. 28 June] 1856.[13][14] His father, Milutin
                    Tesla
                    (1819–1879),[15] was an Eastern Orthodox priest.[16][17][18][19] Tesla's mother, Đuka Mandić
                    (1822–1892), whose father was also an Orthodox priest,[20] had a talent for making home craft tools
                    and
                    mechanical appliances and the ability to memorize Serbian epic poems. Đuka had never received a
                    formal
                    education. Tesla credited his eidetic memory and creative abilities to his mother's genetics and
                    influence.[21][22] Tesla's progenitors were from western Serbia, near Montenegro.[23]
                    <br><br>
                    Tesla was the fourth of five children. He had three sisters, Milka, Angelina and Marica, and an
                    older
                    brother named Dane, who was killed in a horse riding accident when Tesla was aged five.[24] In 1861,
                    Tesla attended primary school in Smiljan where he studied German, arithmetic, and religion.[25] In
                    1862,
                    the Tesla family moved to the nearby Gospić, where Tesla's father earlyed as parish priest. Nikola
                    completed primary school, followed by middle school.[25] In 1870, Tesla moved to Karlovac[26] to
                    attend
                    high school at the Higher Real Gymnasium where the classes were held in German, as it was usual
                    throughout schools within the Austro-Hungarian Military Frontier.[27]

            <p>Tesla's father, Milutin, was an Orthodox priest in the village of Smiljan
                Tesla later wrote that he became interested in demonstrations of electricity by his physics
                professor.[28] Tesla noted that these demonstrations of this "mysterious phenomena" made him want "to
                know more of this wonderful force".[29] Tesla was able to perform integral calculus in his head, which
                prompted his teachers to believe that he was cheating.[30] He finished a four-year term in three years,
                graduating in 1873.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
                In 1873, Tesla returned to Smiljan. Shortly after he arrived, he contracted cholera, was bedridden
                for
                nine months and was near death multiple times. Tesla's father, in a moment of despair, (who had
                originally wanted him to enter the priesthood)[32] promised to send him to the best engineering
                school
                if he recovered from the illness.[25][26]
            </p>
            <p>
                In 1874, Tesla evaded conscription into the Austro-Hungarian Army in Smiljan[33] by running away
                southeast of Lika to Tomingaj, near Gračac. There he explored the mountains wearing hunter's garb.
                Tesla
                said that this contact with nature made him stronger, both physically and mentally.[25] He read many
                books while in Tomingaj and later said that Mark Twain's earlys had helped him to miraculously
                recover
                from his earlier illness.[26]
            </p>
            <p>
                In 1875, Tesla enrolled at Austrian Polytechnic in Graz on a Military Frontier scholarship. During
                his
                first year, Tesla never missed a lecture, earned the highest grades possible, passed nine
                exams[25][26]
                (nearly twice as many as required[34]), started a Serb cultural club,[25] and even received a letter
                of
                commendation from the dean of the technical faculty to his father, which stated, "Your son is a star
                of
                first rank."[34] During his second year, Tesla came into conflict with Professor Poeschl over the
                Gramme
                dynamo, when Tesla suggested that commutators were not necessary.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tesla claimed that he earlyed from 3 a.m. to 11 p.m., no Sundays or holidays excepted.[26] He was
                "mortified when [his] father made light of [those] hard won honors." After his father's death in
                1879,[33] Tesla found a package of letters from his professors to his father, warning that unless he
                were removed from the school, Tesla would die through overearly. At the end of his second year, Tesla
                lost his scholarship and became addicted to gambling.[25][26] During his third year, Tesla gambled
                away
                his allowance and his tuition money, later gambling back his initial losses and returning the
                balance to
                his family. Tesla said that he "conquered [his] passion then and there," but later in the United
                States
                he was again known to play billiards. When examination time came, Tesla was unprepared and asked for
                an
                extension to study, but was denied. He did not receive grades for the last semester of the third
                year
                and he never graduated from the university.[33]

            <p>

                Tesla aged 23, c. 1879
                In December 1878, Tesla left Graz and severed all relations with his family to hide the fact that he
                dropped out of school.[33] His friends thought that he had drowned in the nearby Mur River.[35]
                Tesla
                moved to Maribor, where he earlyed as a draftsman for 60 florins per month. He spent his spare time
                playing cards with local men on the streets.[33]
            </p>
            <p>
                In March 1879, Tesla's father went to Maribor to beg his son to return home, but he refused.[25]
                Nikola
                suffered a nervous breakdown around the same time.[35] On 24 March 1879, Tesla was returned to
                Gospić
                under police guard for not having a residence permit.
            </p>
            <p>
                On 17 April 1879, Milutin Tesla died at the age of 60 after contracting an unspecified illness.[25]
                Some
                sources say that he died of a stroke.[36] During that year, Tesla taught a large class of students
                in
                his old school in Gospić.[25]
            </p>
            <p>
                In January 1880, two of Tesla's uncles put together enough money to help him leave Gospić for
                Prague,
                where he was to study. He arrived too late to enroll at Charles-Ferdinand University; he had never
                studied Greek, a required subject; and he was illiterate in Czech, another required subject. Tesla
                did,
                however, attend lectures in philosophy at the university as an auditor but he did not receive grades
                for
                the courses.[25][37][38]

            <p>
                earlying at Budapest Telephone Exchange
                In 1881, Tesla moved to Budapest, Hungary, to early under Tivadar Puskás at a telegraph company, the
                Budapest Telephone Exchange. Upon arrival, Tesla realized that the company, then under construction,
                was
                not functional, so he earlyed as a draftsman in the Central Telegraph Office instead. Within a few
                months, the Budapest Telephone Exchange became functional, and Tesla was allocated the chief
                electrician
                position.[25] During his employment, Tesla made many improvements to the Central Station equipment
                and
                claimed to have perfected a telephone repeater or amplifier, which was never patented nor publicly
                described.[26]</p>

                In 1882, Tivadar Puskás got Tesla another job in Paris with the Continental Edison Company.[39] Tesla
                began
                working in what was then a brand new industry, installing indoor incandescent lighting citywide in the
                form
                of an electric power utility. The company had several subdivisions and Tesla worked at the Société
                Electrique Edison, the division in the Ivry-sur-Seine suburb of Paris in charge of installing the
                lighting
                system. There he gained a great deal of practical experience in electrical engineering. Management took
                notice of his advanced knowledge in engineering and physics and soon had him designing and building
                improved
                versions of generating dynamos and motors.[40] They also sent him on to troubleshoot engineering
                problems at
                other Edison utilities being built around France and in Germany.
            </p>
            <h5>Move to the United States</h5>
            <p>
                Edison Machine Works on Goerck Street, New York. Tesla found the change from cosmopolitan Europe to
                working
                at this shop, located amongst the tenements on Manhattan's lower east side, a "painful surprise".[41]
                In 1884, Edison manager Charles Batchelor, who had been overseeing the Paris installation, was brought
                back
                to the United States to manage the Edison Machine Works, a manufacturing division situated in New York
                City,
                and asked that Tesla be brought to the United States as well.[42] In June 1884, Tesla emigrated[43] and
                began working almost immediately at the Machine Works on Manhattan's Lower East Side, an overcrowded
                shop
                with a workforce of several hundred machinists, laborers, managing staff, and 20 "field engineers"
                struggling with the task of building the large electric utility in that city.[44] As in Paris, Tesla was
                working on troubleshooting installations and improving generators.[45] Historian W. Bernard Carlson
                notes
                Tesla may have met company founder Thomas Edison only a couple of times.[44] One of those times was
                noted in
                Tesla's autobiography where, after staying up all night repairing the damaged dynamos on the ocean liner
                SS
                Oregon, he ran into Batchelor and Edison, who made a quip about their "Parisian" being out all night.
                After
                Tesla told them he had been up all night fixing the Oregon Edison commented to Batchelor that "this is a
                damned good man".[41] One of the projects given to Tesla was to develop an arc lamp-based street
                lighting
                system.[46][47] Arc lighting was the most popular type of street lighting but it required high voltages
                and
                was incompatible with the Edison low-voltage incandescent system, causing the company to lose contracts
                in
                cities that wanted street lighting as well. Tesla's designs were never put into production, possibly
                because
                of technical improvements in incandescent street lighting or because of an installation deal that Edison
                made with an arc lighting company.[48]
            </p>
            <p>
                Tesla had been working at the Machine Works for a total of six months when he quit.[44] What event
                precipitated his leaving is unclear. It may have been over a bonus he did not receive, either for
                redesigning generators or for the arc lighting system that was shelved.[46] Tesla had previous run-ins
                with
                the Edison company over unpaid bonuses he believed he had earned.[49][50] In his autobiography, Tesla
                stated
                the manager of the Edison Machine Works offered a $50,000 bonus to design "twenty-four different types
                of
                standard machines" "but it turned out to be a practical joke".[51] Later versions of this story have
                Thomas
                Edison himself offering and then reneging on the deal, quipping "Tesla, you don't understand our
                American
                humor".[52][53] The size of the bonus in either story has been noted as odd since Machine Works manager
                Batchelor was stingy with pay[54] and the company did not have that amount of cash (equivalent to $12
                million today[when?]) on hand.[55][56] Tesla's diary contains just one comment on what happened at the
                end
                of his employment, a note he scrawled across the two pages covering 7 December 1884, to 4 January 1885,
                saying "Good by to the Edison Machine Works".[47][57]

            <h4> Tesla's legacy has endured in books, films, radio, TV, music, live theater, comics, and video games.
                The
                impact of the technologies invented or envisioned by Tesla is a recurring theme in several types of
                science
                fiction.</h4>

            <p> He was a pioneer in many fields and his vision included the exploration of solar energy and the power of
                the sea. He also predicted interplanetary communications and satellites. His work led to advances in
                wireless communications, lasers, x-rays, radar, lighting, robotics, and much more. Despite his genius,
                Tesla was often pitted against powerful corporates and government players. He did not receive the
                recognition he deserved and died a poor man on January 1943. When he passed on, his work was seized by
                the government though they were later released to his family.To date, some of his papers are still
                classified by the US government. Some of his popular inventions include: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The AC Motor</li>
                <li>The Tesla Coil</li>
                <li>The Radio</li>
                <li>The Remote Control</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Nikola Tesla was one of the most revolutionary inventors that the world will ever see. Despite his
                groundbreaking innovations, he fell under the shadow of his rivals such as Edison and Marconi. Regarded
                as an eccentric scientist and often ridiculed by his contemporaries, Tesla was a genius ahead of his
                time. His technological advancements transformed not only America but the rest of the world. The
                importance of his contributions is widely recognized today and there is a rock band as well as an
                electric car company named after him. Tesla’s legacy transcends his vision and brilliant achievements in
                the engineering field. He also serves as an inspiration to those who work hard and receive little
                recognition for their efforts.</p>
