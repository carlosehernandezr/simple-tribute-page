                <p>Steven Paul Jobs (/dʒɒbz/; February 24, 1955 – October 5, 2011) was an American business magnate,
                    industrial designer, investor, and media proprietor. He was the chairman, chief executive officer
                    (CEO),
                    and co-founder of Apple Inc., the chairman and majority shareholder of Pixar, a member of The Walt
                    Disney Company's board of directors following its acquisition of Pixar, and the founder, chairman,
                    and
                    CEO of NeXT. Jobs is widely recognized as a pioneer of the personal computer revolution of the 1970s
                    and
                    1980s, along with Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak.</p>

                        Steven Paul Jobs is born in San Francisco to Joanne Carole Schieble and Abdulfattah Jandali. The
                        then-unmarried couple give up their son to adoption. Paul and Clara Jobs become Jobs'
                        non-biological
                        parents.

                        Valley.

                    <li>
                        1968:
                        Jobs calls Bill Hewlett, the co-founder and co-namesake of Hewlett-Packard, looking for spare
                        parts to
                        build a frequency counter. Hewlett gives Jobs the parts, as well as an internship with the

                        1970:
                        Meets future Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak through a friend. In Wozniak's 2006 autobiography,
                        "iWoz,"
                        he notes that the two "hit it off" immediately, despite their four-year age difference.

                        Portland,
                        Ore., only to drop out a semester later. Jobs would go on to sit in on classes that interested
                        him, such
                        as calligraphy, despite not getting credit for them.

                        1974:
                        Begins a brief stint as an engineer at Atari. Working the night shift, he employs Wozniak to

                        whittle down the hardware required for a prototype of a single-player version of Pong, the game
                        that
                        would go on to become Breakout. Jobs leaves Atari in the summer to travel through India, only to
                        return
                        to California to live in a commune.

                        January 24, 1984:
                        Two days after the $1.5 million Ridley Scott-directed "1984" Super Bowl commercial airs,
                        introduces the
                        Macintosh to much fanfare during Apple's shareholder meeting. "For the first time ever, I'd like
                        to let
                        Macintosh speak for itself." The computer's voice then says, "Never trust a computer you can't
                        lift."
                        Macintosh becomes the first commercially successful small computer with a graphical user
                        interface.

                        CEO John Sculley engineers Jobs' ouster from Apple. Jobs resigns as Apple chairman, saying in a
                        board
                        meeting, "I've been thinking a lot, and it's time for me to get on with my life. It's obvious
                        that I've
                        got to do something. I'm 30 years old." Soon thereafter, Jobs starts NeXT Computer (which later
                        becomes
                        NeXT Software), funded by selling $70 million of his Apple stock. An "interpersonal" NeXT
                        workstation,
                        sporting a built-in Ethernet port, is used by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN to become the first server
                        of the
                        World Wide Web.

                        the
                        release of "Toy Story," with Tom Hanks doing the voice of Woody and Tim Allen as Buzz Lightyear.
                        The
                        film earns $192 million at the box office. Its success helps make it quite attractive for
                        celebrities to
                        lend their voices to animated characters.

                        title
                        "iCEO," paying homage to the company's product-naming conventions. Takes a $1 annual salary.

                        and
                        personal sales methods proved to be tremendously popular. Apple was running 330 stores worldwide

                        your
                        entire music collection in your pocket and listen to it wherever you go...With iPod, listening
                        to music

                        than $100...With most flash memory music players, users must use tiny displays and complicated
